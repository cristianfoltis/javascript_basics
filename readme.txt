JavaScript Basics

1. Create a list of pet owners (name, email, phone number, list of pets (pet type, pet name, pet age)) and functions that:
  * returns the list of pet owners (name, email, phone number) who have pets of a certain type
  * returns the average age of all pets owned by pet owners in the list
  * returns the number of pet owners who have not provided their email
  * prints the pet type that shows up most often in the pet owners list
  * checks if every pet owner in the array has at least one pet of a certain type



2. Create a program to determine whether a squared matrix is magic or not. 
Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square#/media/File:Magicsquareexample.svg . 
A squared matrix is magic if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.



3. Create the following data structures:
  1. queue
  2. stack
  3. doubly linked list
and implement operations to insert item, remove item and print all items in the queue / stack / doubly linked list.
